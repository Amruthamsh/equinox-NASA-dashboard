# Equinox — From Space Research to Mission Readiness

## Project Summary

**High-Level Summary**

Our project is an **AI-driven research exploration and mission planning platform** designed to help citizens, scientists, policymakers, and mission planners make sense of NASA’s vast research ecosystem. It connects research publications, funding data, and mission goals into a single interactive environment — enabling **data-driven insights, discovery, and strategic decision-making**.

The platform is organized into three key modules:

1. **Analytics (Explore Papers)** – Users can browse the research dataset, visualize key statistics, and uncover trends such as category evolution over time, funding distribution, and underfunded research areas. An LLM detect anomalies (like funding gaps or outliers) and generate “what-if” simulations to project the impact of funding reallocations.

2. **Knowledge Graph (KG)** – A dynamic, AI-generated graph built using NLP and topic modeling (e.g., BERTopic) to cluster related research papers. Users can interact with clusters, view summaries, compare experiments, and ask natural language questions to reveal relationships, insights, and visual analytics.

3. **Plan Mission** – Integrates insights from the research data to guide mission design (e.g., Mars, Moon, Asteroid). User can set the Mission Paramenters, provide additional context to plan a mission. The dashboard Methodologies, Actionable Insights and fetches the Relevant publications for the given Mission. 

Overall, the system “solves” the challenge of **navigating and interpreting NASA’s complex research landscape** by making it **interactive, explainable, and actionable**. It empowers users to learn and explore NASA's vast data, uncover hidden connections, identify funding gaps, and make informed strategic decisions — ultimately accelerating curiosity, innovation and improving mission planning.
